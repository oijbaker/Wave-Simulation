2D Wave Propogation Simulator

So far simulates:
- Single and double raindrops
- Random raindrops
- Dirichlet and absorbing boundary conditions
- A central circular object
- A small slit to simulate diffraction

To run:

Run either the jupyter notebook, or the cpp files. This will write the frames of the simulation to a temporary file. These files get quite big depending on the resolution and length of the simulation. Then, to visualise, run the plot_sim.py file, but change the relevant variables to 'py' or 'cpp' depending on whether you ran the cpp file or the jupyter notebook.
